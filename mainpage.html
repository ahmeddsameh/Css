  <h3 class="showcase-title">Photography</h3>
  <img src="images/me.jpg" class="me">
  Growing up, I was always interested in photos and how you can tell an entire story from a simple good picture. Years later, that interest grew into an amteur photography hobby. Although this hobby is time consuming and quite expensive, (when you take into account equipment and software costs), it can be pretty refreshing and freeing to have the ability to tell your own story through a picture.

  <h3 class="showcase-title">FreeLancing </h3>
  For as long as I can remember, I have always been interested in finance and business. The idea of providing a service in return for a source of income, always excited me, that is why I started freelancing. For years I would edit people’s videos on premiere pro in exchange for a charge. When I started I noticed people with high ratings attracted the most clients. So in order to attract clients I started by working on projects for free until my ratings were high enough to earn the trust of clients and slowly I started raising my average charge.

  <h3 class="showcase-title">Business </h3>
  <img src="images/fan.png" class="bussiness">
  Real estate, stocks, crypto, all words dreaded by most due to the incredibly unpredictable and volatile nature of today’s markets. Covid, no doubt affected all financial markets, but where some lose their money, some make theirs. This volatile market may have been disastrous for lots, but it provides invaluable opportunities for lots more. Extremely undervalued stocks are up for grabs. The recent real estate stresses may have made home owners reluctant to sell, but bankrupt properties are on the rise and have been since 2020. This all proves my passion for business
